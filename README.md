# memory basics

g++ main.cpp -lSDL2

Implements a few basic memory management structures: General purpose, pool and stack allocators, and tests these to some degree.

Also includes various basic utilities (such as random and frametimer), many of which are imported from somewhere else and are re-fitted in a convenient way.
