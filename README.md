# memory basics

g++ main.cpp

Hosts a few home-grown utilities, including:

- Basic memory management structures: General purpose, pool and stack allocators.

- An array wrapper which add support for Add() Insert() and Remove() to C-style arrays.

- A wrapper for RNGs found on the web (see random.h for details).

These are all not meant as end-all solutions, and intended as light-weight alternatives: Compact, understandable and therefore modifiable.
